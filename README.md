## WebWorm


</div>

### Description

This is a pretty interesting little program. Using the MS Webbrowser control, it searches a webpage for all its links and stores them in an collection. After it has finished a page, it goes to the next page and scans that one.

This little example application looks for email addresses. But don't be afraid, it's much to slow for being used by spammers.
